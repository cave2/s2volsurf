Follow the instructions below to see the xrw2pdf tool in action,
producing a volume-rendered PDF figure of a NIFTI image, with an 
isosurface overlaid.

1. fetch the example NIFTI image "avg152T1_LR_nifti.nii.gz" from this
   site: http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/data

   curl -o avg152T1.nii.gz http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/data/avg152T1_LR_nifti.nii.gz 

2. convert the NIFTI image to an XRW-format volume:

   nifti2xrw -f avg152T1.nii.gz -o avg152T1.xrw

3. [optional] display a summary of the XRW-format volume:

   xrwinfo avg152T1.xrw

4. [optional] display a histogram of the XRW-format volume:

   xrwhisto avg152T1.xrw 

5. run xrw2pdf to render the volume:

   xrw2pdf -f avg152T1.xrw -z -c hotiron -d 0 0.1 -a 0 0.2 -DX

   #  -z = calculated and render scalar volume derivative;
   #  -c hotiron = use hotiron colourmap
   #  -d 0 0.1 = map data range [0,0.1] to colourmap
   #  -a 0 0.2 = apply opacity ramp [0,0.2] across colourmap
   #  -DX = clip data outside data range [0,0.1] 

   Press Shift-B (to enable PDF-compatible volume rendering)

   Press Shift-P to save PRC and PDF figure

6. Press Shift-Q to quit the xrw2pdf program

7. To add an isosurface to the visualisation:

   xrw2stl -f avg152T1.xrw -o avg152T1.stl -l 0.8

   # -l 0.8 = set isosurface level 0.8

   xrw2pdf -f avg152T1.xrw -d 0.05 0.2 -a 0.0 0.2 -DX -o avg152T1.stl SurfName 0 0.5 1 1 -x

   # -o avg152T1.stl SurfName 0 0.5 1 1 = add the surface in avg152T1.stl, name it SurfName in
             the model tree, colour it blue-green, opaque
   # -x = don't draw the world box

   # and again press Shift-B to enabled PDF-compatible VR, Shift-P to save a
   # new PRC and PDF figure, and Shift-Q to quit.

The output files, written to the current working directory, are:

* s2direct.prc: PRC-format (binary) 3-d figure for embedding in LaTeX
  with movie15.sty or media9.sty and pdflatex.

* s2direct.map: text-format summary of the model components (can be
  used by downstream programs/scripts to create custom interactions 
  and views in PDF figures created with pdflatex.

* s2plotprc.pdf: quick-look PDF figure.
